# A wee bit miffed ducks

## What is this?

This is a wee bit miffed ducks. It's a small game I made for my elementary programming class. It's a
simple game where you have to shoot ducks that fly across the screen. It's not very good, and I strongly suggest just
downloading angry birds.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Pipenv
- Required packages (see `Pipfile`)

## Installation

Clone the repository with `git clone`
Create a virtual environment with `pipenv shell`
Install dependencies with `pipenv install`

## How do I play?

Simply run the `main.py` file with `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` if needed.

Game gives you instructions on actual gameplay and you might find it familiar.

## Level editor

Level editor was made for me to make levels for the game.
Run it with `python level_editor.py` and it will create level files when you save the level.

Level editor prompts you for the level name, description and duck count in the console when saving.

## TODO

- [] Add hard crates
- [] Add more levels
